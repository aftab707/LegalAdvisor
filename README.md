# Legal Advisor: Public Guidance in Islamic and Pakistani Law
Legal Advisor is an AI-powered platform designed to bridge the gap between complex legal statutes and public understanding in Pakistan. By utilizing Explainable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (X-RAG), the system provides dual-law guidance, offering side-by-side insights from both Pakistani Statutory Law and Islamic Sharia.

## Project Overview
In Pakistan, many citizens struggle with legal rights due to complex language and high costs. This project provides a transparent, reliable, and bilingual (English/Urdu) chatbot that retrieves information from trusted legal sources and explains its reasoning to foster public trust.

## Tech Stack
